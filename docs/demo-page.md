**Meet Alexis** - our **technical lead** who can debug complex systems while simultaneously perfecting her sourdough starter (yes, both require patience and precise timing). When she's not architecting elegant solutions or mentoring junior developers, you can find her teaching her cat Matrix to respond to shell commands – although so far, the cat only responds to 'sudo treat time'.

**Meet David** - spends his days orchestrating containers and his nights as an amateur astronomer, convinced that Kubernetes clusters and constellation patterns share some cosmic connection. After automating himself out of most of his daily tasks, he now dedicates his extra time to building an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine that makes the perfect cup of coffee using only CI/CD pipelines and Docker containers.

**Meet Ted** - Ted is living proof that you can be a DevOps wizard while maintaining an impressive collection of vintage arcade cabinets - his proudest achievement is setting up monitoring alerts that ping his Pac-Man machine when there's a system failure. When he's not fine-tuning pipelines or debugging infrastructure, he's working on his secret project: teaching his smart home system to respond exclusively in 80s movie quotes.

## The Engagement

Client Name, Industry, and Company Size

	•	Client Name: Velocity Bank
	•	Industry: Financial Services
	•	Company Size: Mid-Market (2,500 employees)

Velocity Bank is experiencing significant delays in delivering new features to their customers due to inefficiencies in their software development lifecycle. Teams work in silos, handoffs between development, operations, and security are unclear, and there is no clear ownership of production issues. This has led to:

	•	Slow time-to-market for critical features.
	•	Frequent incidents and high downtime.
	•	Low employee morale due to unclear responsibilities and reactive work.

This engagement focuses on establishing a foundation for DevOps practices within Velocity Bank to accelerate feature delivery and improve system reliability.
Key deliverables include:

	1.	Creating a team charter to define roles, responsibilities, and engagement norms across the cross-functional team.
	2.	Implementing a shared deployment pipeline with automated testing and security scanning.
	3.	Conducting training sessions on monitoring and incident management for on-call engineers.
	4.	Aligning leadership on metrics to measure success, such as deployment frequency, lead time, and Mean Time to Restore (MTTR).

The engagement will span 12 weeks, culminating in a collaborative “go-live” phase for the first production pipeline supported by the newly established team.
