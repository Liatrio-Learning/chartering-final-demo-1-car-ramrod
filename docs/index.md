# Your Team Name Here

Introduce your project here (yes, I said *project* - it'll be alright) You can break your content down week by week, section by section, or however you see fit!

## Week 1: Meet the Team

Introduce your team! Who are you, what are your roles/specialties, what are some non-work related things about you? Think of this as showing the client how awesome you will be to work with (since they already know you're smart and capable as heck - otherwise we wouldn't be doing this engagement!)

## Week 2: Engagement Overview

Tell the story of the Engagement Overview. What assets did you use to complete this section? Is there any information that would have been helpful to add to the engagement docs? Write a synopsis here.

Then, upload a video or link a Loom walking through the process of completing the Engagement Overview section of the Miro template. Imagine you're explaining this to someone who is new to engagements and the charter process.

## Week 3 Engineering Overview

Tell the story of the Engineering Overview. How did you choose your tooling? What led you to those decisions? What skills are you looking for your team members to have for this engagement? Write a synopsis here.

Then, upload a video or link a Loom walking through the process of completing the Engineering Overview section of the Miro template. Imagine you're explaining this to someone who is new to engagements and the charter process.

## Week 4: Working Agreement and Client Kickoff

Walk us through the creation of your kickoff deck - what information did you choose to include, why is this valuable to the client, what is/are the expected outcome(s) of the presentation?

Then, upload a video or link a Loom of your team presenting the kickoff deck exactly like you would to a client.

## Retro

Set aside time to do a retro with your team. You can use any format you choose (see README for ideas and templates). Share your findings below.
