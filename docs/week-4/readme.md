## What's Next

Review the Miro board template with your team. For week 1, your assignment will be to pull up as a group and assign roles and responsibilities for the work going forward. You should also look ahead at weeks 2-4 and schedule a time to work on the charter together, as well as record your demos. Plan to block off 30-45 minutes each week to pull up and walk through your updates together, and another 10-15 to record your demo as a group.
